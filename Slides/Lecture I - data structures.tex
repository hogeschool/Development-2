\SlideSection{Introduction}
\SlideSubSection{Lecture topics}
\begin{slide}{
\item The previous quarter we have shown a form of abstaction by the use of functions
\item Building useful abstraction only once makes it possible to reuse their definition
\item Many data structures (tuples, lists, maps, sets, etc.) become thus a new layer of abstraction
}\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{
\item Manipulating these data structures happens in user code
\item Often, user code needs to perform operations that are similar to each other
\item Similar operations should not require rewriting everything every time
}\end{slide}


\SlideSubSection{Lecture topics}
\begin{slide}{
\item Mechanism of abstraction
\item The need for data structures
\item Classes as data structures in Python
\item Tuples and records
}\end{slide}

\SlideSection{What is abstraction?}
\SlideSubSection{Introduction}
\begin{slide}{
\item The big issue of the whole course is \textbf{abstraction} in programming
\item Abstraction is a fundamental concept in programming to reduce repetition
\item We sit atop a mountain of abstraction, which we make taller at every iteration
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{Grab the student next to you}
\begin{slide}{
\item Describe what you just did so that someone else can perform the same action
\pause
\item Now add specific details about the movements of your arm and phalanges (pieces of fingers)
\pause
\item Now realize that there are even more subcomponents: individual muscles, tendons, etc.
\pause
\item But then we have also cells that make these up
\item ...
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{Human love for abstraction}
\begin{slide}{
\item Our brain cannot handle so many details
\item To cope with this, we are structured in layers
\item Our consciousness manipulates only the upper layers with simple instructions
\item \textit{Raise arm above head}
}\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{
\item The same happens with regular language
\item ``\textit{Go buy a liter of milk}'' is quite a short description
\item The underlying operation is very complex
}\end{slide}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Complexity of simple instructions}
\begin{lstlisting}
Go buy a liter of milk =
  Turn game off
  Get up from the couch
  Curse the instruction giver
  Get dressed
  Put money in pocket
  Leave house
  Reach nearest shop
  Enter shop
  Find milk
  Take one liter bottle
  Pay milk
  Go home
  Give milk to instruction giver
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{slide}{
\item And clearly something like ``\textit{reach nearest shop}'' is not a trivial instruction by itself
\item Think about all the things you give for granted
\begin{itemize}
\item Crossing roads
\item Traffic lights
\item Pathfinding
\item Road work and obstructions
\item Use of transportation methods
\item ...
\end{itemize}
}\end{slide}

\item We have a similar issue with a modern computer

\SlideSubSection{What kind of ``\textit{own stuff}''?}
\begin{slide}{
\item Any recurring structure, code, etc.
\item We do not want to repeat it every time
\item We just give it a name, instead of specifying it every time
\item The actual goal is to make things simpler
\begin{itemize}
\item Code reuse, maintainability, etc. do not exist
\item It is all just \textbf{properly built abstractions that make reasoning about code easier}
\end{itemize}

\SlideSubSection{Make some examples}
\begin{slide}{
\item \textbf{Everyone make an example of repeated structures of data.}
\item \textbf{Some of you will present theirs}
}\end{slide}

\SlideSection{General idea}
\SlideSubSection{Introduction}
\begin{slide}{
\item A possible solution to this problem is capturing the repetition of data structures
\item With a name, and a specification of what is common about them
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{Fundamental ingredients of the solution}
\begin{slide}{
\item Brains of the programmer, always active
\item Abstraction requires awareness and experience
\item It is as much technique as it is art
}\end{slide}
% Not only about how you define datastructures, but at least as much a design art (creative and thinking come into play)


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Repeated code}
\begin{lstlisting}
playerOneName = "P1"
playerOnePositionX = 0.0
playerOnePositionY = 0.0

playerTwoName = "P2"
playerTwoPositionX = 5.0
playerTwoPositionY = 0.0

playerThreeName = "P3"
playerThreePositionX = 10.0
playerThreePositionY = 0.0
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{slide}{
\item We observe that there is an underlying pattern, which we will call \textbf{abstraction}
\item The pattern, or abstraction, comes repeated in several \textbf{concrete instances} in our program
\pause
\item In the program above this is fairly obvious, in real life not always really :)
}\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{
\item A proper name for the abstraction
\item \textbf{For example?} \pause \texttt{Player}
}\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{
\item A set of common attributes
\item All characterizing aspects of the abstraction that are common to all its instances
\item \textbf{For example?} \pause \texttt{Name}, \texttt{PositionX}, \texttt{PositionY}
}\end{slide}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The blueprint (\textbf{THIS IS NOT CODE!})}
\begin{lstlisting}
Abstraction Player =
  Name, which is a sequence of characters
  PositionX, which is a number
  PositionY, which is a number
\end{lstlisting}

The abstraction above is called a \textbf{data structure}.

It is not valid Python code, but it is a blueprint specifying a recurrent set of attributes that often go together to identify a player.

\end{frame}

\SlideSection{Technical details}
\SlideSubSection{How is this done in Python?}
\begin{slide}{
\item Python offers a facility called \texttt{class}
\item It is used to capture a data structure.
}\end{slide}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Syntax of Python classes}
\begin{lstlisting}
class <<Name>>:
  def __init__(self, <<v1>>, <<v2>>, ..., <<vN>):
    self.<<A1>> = <<v1>>
    self.<<A2>> = <<v2>>
    ...
    self.<<AN>> = <<vN>>
\end{lstlisting}

The class has thus: \texttt{name}, \texttt{initial values} $v_1$ through $v_N$, and \texttt{attributes} $A_1$ through $A_N$ initialized with \texttt{\_\_init\_\_}.

\texttt{self} is a reference to the \texttt{concrete instance} that is being set up.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Usage of Python classes}
\begin{lstlisting}
x = <<Name>>(<<v1>>, <<v2>>, ..., <<vN>)
\end{lstlisting}

Sets up a \texttt{concrete instance} of \texttt{<<Name>>} with some \texttt{initial values}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Usage of Python classes}
\begin{lstlisting}
print(x.<<A2>>)
\end{lstlisting}

Prints the value of the second \texttt{attribute} of the \texttt{concrete instance} called \texttt{x} of class \texttt{<<Name>>}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Usage of Python classes}
\begin{lstlisting}
x.<<A3>> = y
\end{lstlisting}

Assigns \texttt{y} as the new value of the third \texttt{attribute} of the \texttt{concrete instance} called \texttt{x} of class \texttt{<<Name>>}.
\end{frame}

\SlideSubSection{Semantics of Python classes}
\begin{slide}{
\item The semantics of Python classes require a more sophisticated model of memory
\item Memory is now divided in two
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{STACK}] The state that we used so far, for primitive values (\texttt{int}, \texttt{string}, etc.)
\item[\textbf{HEAP}] A storage for complex values such as classes
\end{description}
}\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{
\item An instruction \texttt{I} will now transform the initial heap and stack \texttt{H,S} into the resulting (possibly changed) heap and stack \texttt{H',S'} \footnote{in addition to the program counter \texttt{PC}, which always behaves in the same way}

$$<PC,H,S> \overset{I}{\rightarrow} <PC',H',S'>$$
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{Semantics of creation}
\begin{slide}{
\item Consider creation of a Python class: \texttt{x = <<Name>>(...)} (shortened to \texttt{xName})
\item This affects both memories
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{HEAP}] We create and initialize a new instance of class \texttt{<<Name>>}
\item[\textbf{STACK}] We add an entry \texttt{x} to the stack, which references to the newly created instance
\end{description}
}\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{
\item Given that:
\item $|H|$ is the size of the heap at creation, which we call the \textbf{address} of the new instance
\item $\llangle Name \rrangle(...)$ is a new instance of the class, which contains a map from the attribute names to their values

\fontsize{8pt}{7.2}\selectfont
$$<PC,H,S> \overset{xName}{\rightarrow} <PC+1,H[|H| \mapsto \llangle Name \rrangle(\dots)],S[x \mapsto |H|]>$$

\item \texttt{x} is, unsurprisingly, called a \textbf{reference}
\begin{itemize}
\item it does not contain the value of the class instance
\item it merely tells us where to find it
\end{itemize}
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{Attribute lookup}
\begin{slide}{
\item Consider reading an attribute (also called lookup)
\item \texttt{x.<<A>>} (shortened to \texttt{xA})\footnote{\pause This is not a full instruction, but an \textbf{expression}. For this reason, we use another kind of arrow, $\hookrightarrow$, to denote that we simply evaluate the expression but do not change the state of the program.}
\item Where is it in memory?
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{STACK}] We find an entry \texttt{x}, which tells us where the corresponding instance of the class is found 
\item[\textbf{HEAP}] We find the actual attribute in the map of attributes
\end{description}

$$<PC,H,S> \overset{xA}{\hookrightarrow} H[S[x]][A]$$
}\end{slide}



\SlideSubSection{Attribute update}
\begin{slide}{
\item Consider assigning to an attribute
\item \texttt{x.<<A>> = v} (shortened to \texttt{xAv})
\item Where is it in memory?
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{STACK}] We find an entry \texttt{x}, which tells us where the corresponding instance of the class is found 
\item[\textbf{HEAP}] We reassign the actual attribute in the map of attributes
\end{description}

$$<PC,H,S> \overset{xAv}{\rightarrow} <PC+1,H[S[x] \mapsto H[S[x]][A \mapsto v]]$$
% TODO add "how to read it"
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{Examples}
\begin{slide}{
\item We can now implement our player data type
\item We will use a Python class to do so
\item We will then create concrete instances of it, and use them
}\end{slide}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The blueprint to implement}
\begin{lstlisting}
Abstraction Player =
  Name, which is a string
  PositionX, which is a number
  PositionY, which is a number
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The implemented class}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Player:
  def __init__(self, name, posX, posY):
    self.Name = name
    self.PositionX = posX
    self.PositionY = posY
\end{lstlisting}

playerOneName = "P1"

playerTwoPositionX = 5.0
playerTwoPositionY = 0.0

playerThreeName = "P3"
playerThreePositionX = 10.0
playerThreePositionY = 0.0
\end{lstlisting}

Becomes:

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Using the concrete instances}
Suppose we wish to access \texttt{playerOne.PositionX}

\begin{memorytable}
{|c|c|c|c|}
{PC & playerOne & playerTwo & playerThree}
{4 & ref(0) & ref(1) & ref(2)}
{|c|c|c|}
{0 & 1 & 2}
{[N $\mapsto$ "P1"; PX $\mapsto$ 0.0; PY $\mapsto$ 0.0] & ... & ...}
\end{memorytable}

\pause

First we look in the stack:

\begin{memorytable}
{|c|c|c|c|}
{PC & playerOne & playerTwo & playerThree}
{5 & \red{ref(0)} & ref(1) & ref(2)}
{|c|c|c|}
{0 & 1 & 2}
{[N $\mapsto$ "P1"; PX $\mapsto$ 0.0; PY $\mapsto$ 0.0] & ... & ...}
\end{memorytable}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Using the concrete instances}
Suppose we wish to access \texttt{playerOne.PositionX}

\begin{memorytable}
{|c|c|c|c|}
{PC & playerOne & playerTwo & playerThree}
{5 & \red{ref(0)} & ref(1) & ref(2)}
{|c|c|c|}
{0 & 1 & 2}
{[N $\mapsto$ "P1"; PX $\mapsto$ 0.0; PY $\mapsto$ 0.0] & ... & ...}
\end{memorytable}

\pause

Then we look in the heap:

\begin{memorytable}
{|c|c|c|c|}
{PC & playerOne & playerTwo & playerThree}
{5 & ref(0) & ref(1) & ref(2)}
{|c|c|c|}
{0 & 1 & 2}
{\red{[N $\mapsto$ "P1"; PX $\mapsto$ 0.0; PY $\mapsto$ 0.0]} & ... & ...}
\end{memorytable}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Using the concrete instances}
Suppose we wish to access \texttt{playerOne.PositionX}

\begin{memorytable}
{|c|c|c|c|}
{PC & playerOne & playerTwo & playerThree}
{5 & ref(0) & ref(1) & ref(2)}
{|c|c|c|}
{0 & 1 & 2}
{\red{[N $\mapsto$ "P1"; PX $\mapsto$ 0.0; PY $\mapsto$ 0.0]} & ... & ...}
\end{memorytable}

\pause

Finally we search the right attribute (\texttt{PositionX}):

\begin{memorytable}
{|c|c|c|c|}
{PC & playerOne & playerTwo & playerThree}
{5 & ref(0) & ref(1) & ref(2)}
{|c|c|c|}
{0 & 1 & 2}
{[N $\mapsto$ "P1"; \red{PX $\mapsto$ 0.0}; PY $\mapsto$ 0.0] & ... & ...}
\end{memorytable}

\begin{slide}{
\item Abstraction is the fundamental mechanism that allows us to group concepts together and refer to them as if they were a single concept
\item For example, a name and two numbers became a \texttt{player}
\item We then use the new concept (the \texttt{player}) without having to explicitly mention all of its components every time
\item This makes it leaner for us to manipulate complex programs, as less concepts (``actors'') make an appearance
