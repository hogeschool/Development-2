    "## Introduction\n",
    "This is the course descriptor for the _Development 2_ course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development 2 covers the concepts in and around functional abstraction. The course opens with a description of the mechanisms of abstraction and its relationship to code reuse. It then moves on to a discussion about the semantics of function call. The stack is shown as a parameter storage, which plays a particularly interesting role when functions call other functions. Recursion is then introduced as a mechanism for calling a function from within its own body. Finally, we will introduce higher order functions and anonymous (lambda) functions. We will ultimately also combine all of these concepts (recursion, higher order functions, and anonymous functions) in large architectures based on some generic code. \n",
    "Many concrete examples are shown throughout the whole course: given the abstract nature of the concepts, we will strive towards showing many instances of these topics in action. The examples are small in size, but complex and exemplary in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important reminder: the course (and the whole Informatica degree of Hogeschool Rotterdam as well, for that matter) is not meant to provide students with a series of tips and tricks to be quickly successful at one's job. Rather, the course aims to build a solid foundation upon which learning of all sorts of programming languages will be based. This *will*, without a doubt, prepare students not only for their first professional tasks, but for all their evolutions. Moreover, understanding of these concepts will allow students to wield their professional tools (programming languages) with certainty instead of intuition, thereby greatly increasing the quality of what they deliver and their value on the job market."

    "### Learning goals\n",
    "The course has the following learning goals:\n",
    "- (ICODE) students can _recognize and formally interpret_ components of a programming language in their formal semantics: function definition, stack, function call, anonymous function, recursion, higher order function;\n",
    "- (ECODE) students _understand code_; _understand_ here means that students can describe the effect of running the program by predicting the sequence of state transitions produced by its execution;\n",
    "- (WCODE) students can _write small snippets of code_ in order to complete an existing program, from a clearly given specification of the state transitions that the completed program is expected to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course, and therefore also the learning goals, are limited to imperative programs featuring a pervasive functional core, and the following Python 3 keywords and operators: \n",
    "- `def`\n",
    "- `return`\n",
    "- `lambda`\n",
    "\n",
    "All concepts and keywords learnt during the previous development courses (_Development 1_) are assumed to be available and built upon.\n",

    "### Exam\n",
    "The exam is divided in two parts:\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "- (FA) a series of four (4) *forward assignments*, that is exercises where students, given full code and partial state transitions produced by the code, are requested to complete the missing state transitions the code will produce;\n",
    "- (MC) a series of eight (8) *multiple choice* questions on the formal interpretation of state transitions induced by statements, expression evaluation, and state manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice\n",
    "- (BA) a series of five (5) *backward assignments*, that is exercises where students, given partial code and the desired state transitions, are requested to fill in the missing code that matches the given state transitions.\n",

    "## Lecture plan\n",
    "The course is made up of eight lectures and practicums, usually planned as one lecture and one practicum per lesson week (for details, see lesson schedule on HINT). \n",
    "The lectures begin with an introduction of the basic concepts, which are then elaborated during the practicums. The lectures handle the theory, plus applied examples. Some of the applied examples are then further elaborated during the practicums.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson units covered by the course are the following:\n",
    "- Abstract vs concrete\n",
    "- Functional abstraction\n",
    "- Function definition and call\n",
    "- The stack\n",
    "- Functions calling other functions\n",
    "- Recursion and the induction principle\n",
    "- Higher order functions\n",
    "- Anonymous functions\n",
    "- An example applied to drawing: a higher order raster drawing function and an algebra of predicates \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each lesson unit does not necessarily correspond to one lesson week (for example, one lesson unit could span during two lesson weeks or two lesson units could be handled during one lesson week)."

    "## Study points and contact time\n",
    "The course awards students 4 ECTS, in correspondence with 112 hours of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course consists of eight frontal lectures for the theory, and eight assisted practicums. The rest is self-study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the end of the sixth week (11-01-2019) at least 75% of all exercises of practicums 1 to 5 must be completed and correct. This includes the multiple choice questions, forward assignments and backward assignments. Students who fail to meet this criterion will receive a warning. The SLCs of these students will also be notified."
